functions: 

[0] Read the input net-list

getNumLines # get number of lines in the netlist
getPI #get primary input gates
getPO #get primary output gates
getConnects #get gate connections 

[1] Perform fault collapsing

for a gate with controlling value c and inversion i

all the input s-a-c faults and the output s-a-(c@i) are functionally equivalent
the output s -a -(C<Â±>i) fault dominates any input s -a -c fault

[2] List fault classes

list fault universe (initally all s-a-X faults for all inputs and output gates)
list collapsed fault universe (if [1] was called first)
